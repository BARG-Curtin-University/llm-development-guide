## Introduction

While prompt engineering, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and fine-tuning approaches can handle the majority of LLM use cases, there are situations where it may make sense to build a large language model from scratch. This guide reviews the key aspects of developing a foundational LLM based on the experiences with models such as GPT-3, LLaMA, Falcon, and others.

## Financial Considerations

Developing an LLM from scratch involves significant financial investment, including costs for GPU hours, hardware, energy, and personnel. Understanding these costs helps in making informed decisions about when and why to pursue building an LLM.

## Key Steps in Developing an LLM

### Data Curation

The quality of an LLM is driven by the quality of its training data. This section covers the importance of data curation, sources of training data, and key preprocessing steps such as quality filtering, de-duplication, privacy redaction, and tokenization.

### Model Architecture

Transformers are the state-of-the-art approach for language modeling. This section details the different types of transformers (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder) and other design choices such as residual connections, layer normalization, activation functions, and position embeddings.

### Training at Scale

Training LLMs at scale involves techniques like mixed precision training, 3D parallelism, and the Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO). This section discusses these techniques and strategies for maintaining training stability, including checkpointing, weight decay, and gradient clipping.

### Evaluation

Model development is iterative and involves evaluating model performance on various tasks. This section covers common benchmarks and evaluation methods, including prompt templates, human evaluation, and NLP metrics like Perplexity, BLEU, and ROGUE scores.

## Conclusion

Building an LLM from scratch is a complex and resource-intensive process. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the key steps involved, helping you make informed decisions about LLM development.
